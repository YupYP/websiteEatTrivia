              <h2>Nasi kerabu</h2>
              <p>This complex Malaysian dish consists of tinted rice that is served alongside various accompaniments. Although it can vary in color, the rice in nasi kerabu is traditionally blue since it is cooked together with petals of the butterfly pea flower.
                The essential accompaniments to rice are shredded vegetables such as long beans, bean sprouts, cabbage, or cucumbers that are generously seasoned with fresh herbs. Other typical accompaniments include salted eggs, fried fish or chicken, sambal, fermented fish paste, grated coconut, stuffed green chilis, or fish crackers.

              <h2>Nasi Lemak</h2>
              <p>No other dish in Malaysia is as famous as nasi lemak. It consists of rice cooked in coconut milk that is traditionally served with anchovies, cucumbers, peanuts, and boiled eggs. The dish is rounded up with the addition of a spicy chili paste called sambal. Although originally invented as a breakfast dish, soon it surpassed its original purpose and became the Malaysian national dish which can be eaten at any time. Its invention occurred from the mere necessity to exploit all ingredients which were at hand, and the popularity of nasi lemak has continually risen that is frequently sold by Malaysian street vendors.

              <h2>Nasi Tomato</h2>
              <p>Nasi Tomato (or Tomato Rice) is a flavorful Malaysian side dish. But with the complex mix of sweet and tart tastes in this dish, it can easily be served on its own. It is typically served with Ayam Masak Merah (which is a lightly spicy chicken dish simmered in a sauce with tomatoes). The combination is so rich and flavorful that it is often served at weddings.Another substitution in this recipe is the use of coconut milk rather than whole milk. The flavor of the coconut milk adds a little nutty flavor and rich creamy texture that, in my opinion, elevates the dish.

              <h2>Nasi Briyani</h2>
              <p>Originally from Persia, and introduced in India by Mughal rulers, the dish is a delight to eat and a challenge for chefs to prepare. In a perfect pot of biryani, every grain of rice is separate, yet infused with aromas of various spices and has meat or vegetables paired with it. Nasi Briyani is a rice dish flavored with spices and rose water. The word “nasi” is rice in Malay. This aromatic rice is the base for all your meat biryanis. You can also serve it separately, topped with your choice of curries.

The broth served alongside the noodles is made with coconut milk and creamy fish paste, and is usually seasoned with ginger, shallots, and garlic. The whole dish is complemented by various vegetables such as sliced cucumbers or green beans and is usually accompanied by spicy sambal. Laksam is traditionally enjoyed as a warm, hearty breakfast.

              <h2>Kebab</h2>
              <p>Usually served as an appetizer with chutneys and dips, kebabs are made with minced meat and mild spices. Though lamb is the original meat used in kebabs, this dish has been localized to include beef, goat, chicken and other meat varieties. In India, kebab has been a symbol of opulence. Most of the famous kebabs like Galouti, Shami and Kakori originated in the Royal kitchens. Traditionally served in the Moghul courts, today it has transformed into a common street food.

              <h2>Bihun Sup</h2>
              <p>Bihun Sup or Vermicelli in Beef Broth is our specialty dish, one of many dishes we will miss when we are far away from our home. Bihun is a Malay word that means rice vermicelli. Rice vermicelli by itself is tasteless and soaks up the flavors of the ingredients that it’s cooked with. Hence, it is very versatile. Normally, rice vermicelli is stir-fried or made into soup noodle, like this one. The broth is light yet flavorsome, which has the influence of Malay, Chinese and Thai.

              <p>The pasta is cooked in moderately salted boiling water. The guanciale is briefly fried in a pan in its own fat. A mixture of raw eggs (or yolks), grated Pecorino romano and a liberal amount of ground black pepper is combined with the hot pasta either in the pasta pot or in a serving dish, but away from direct heat, to avoid curdling the egg. The fried guanciale is then added, and the mixture is tossed, creating a rich, creamy sauce with bits of meat spread throughout.
